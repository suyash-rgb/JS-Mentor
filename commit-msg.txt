refactor: Migrate from Gemini API to Grok API with enhanced markdown rendering

BREAKING CHANGES:
- Removed Gemini API integration and replaced with Grok's OpenAI-compatible endpoint
- Changed API endpoint from Gemini to https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/responses
- Updated request/response structure to match Grok's API format

FEATURES:
- Integrated Grok API (openai/gpt-oss-20b model) for JavaScript-related queries
- Implemented JavaScript relevance checking before processing queries
- Added proper markdown rendering with react-markdown and remark-gfm plugins
- Enhanced response formatting with styled table, list, code block, and heading support
- Added console logging for debugging API responses and JavaScript relevance checks

IMPROVEMENTS:
- Preserved JavaScript validation logic that checks if user query is JS-related
- Generic response shown for non-JavaScript questions directing users to relevant topics
- Proper extraction of message content from Grok's reasoning model output array
- Styled markdown components (tables with borders, syntax-highlighted code blocks, formatted lists)
- Added custom component styling for h1-h3 headers, paragraphs, links, and horizontal rules
- Improved error handling with try-catch blocks and error state management
- Enhanced UX with loading spinner and disabled button state during API calls

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- Request structure: { model: "openai/gpt-oss-20b", input: "..." }
- Response parsing: Extract message object from response.data.output array
- Environment variable: REACT_APP_GROK_API_KEY for API authentication
- Added remark-gfm plugin for GitHub Flavored Markdown (tables, strikethrough, etc.)
- Customized ReactMarkdown components for consistent styling and formatting

DEPENDENCIES:
- axios (already installed - used for API calls)
- react-markdown (newly added - for rendering markdown)
- remark-gfm (newly added - for GFM table support)

TESTING:
- Verified API connectivity and response parsing
- Tested JavaScript relevance detection with various queries
- Confirmed markdown rendering for tables, code blocks, and formatted text
- Validated error handling and loading states

This refactor modernizes the AI assistant by switching to a more cost-effective and 
performant API while significantly improving response formatting and user experience.
