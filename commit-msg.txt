Fix: Prevent document.write() from destroying compiler UI

Bug: When users called document.write() in the JS compiler, it implicitly 
triggered document.open(), which cleared the entire DOM and destroyed the 
React component structure (compiler UI, navbar, footer disappeared).

Root Cause: document.write() after page load clears all HTML elements, 
making it incompatible with modern single-page applications.

Fix: Override document.write() to redirect its output to the output panel 
instead of modifying the actual DOM. This allows users to safely use 
document.write() while preserving the compiler interface.

Impact: Users can now run code with document.write() without breaking 
the frontend. Output is properly captured and displayed in the output panel.
